# Output

This directory contains all results and logs generated from simulations.

## Structure

- **data/** – Simulation results, including probability distributions, entanglement entropy, and state fidelity.  
- **logs/** – Job output logs, error files, and run summaries from HPC runs.

## Notes

- Keep `data/` for results only; do not store intermediate or temporary files here.  
- Logs are separated for easier debugging and traceability with HPC systems.
