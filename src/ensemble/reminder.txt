Here I will just write a reminder on the progress of this project.

I guess ensemble will be the largest file with 12 functions.

12 functions for 12 different runs where lots of them will be repeated.

Why?

This is because you cannot njit using python functions so we will have a lot of repeat throughout the codes. I will write unit tests to see i
if the results are similar to that where I have used functions from operators and observables instead.

After that I will utilise some timing code, perhaps with jupyter notebook. Just to see whether there is in fact a speedup with the codes and where they can be optimised.

I think after that, it just needs some cleanup and plottings and perhaps HPC cluster work then it is fine. Finished for now more or less??
